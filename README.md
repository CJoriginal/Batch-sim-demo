# Welcome to the STFC Batch Simulator Demo

## About

The Demo was created and designed by Josh Hadley, a Year in Industry Studenty, for STFC RAL to use during the Site Open Day hosted on 11th July.

The Batch Simulator Demo is a short and simple Tetris-inspired game that seeks to introduce people to the idea of a Batch Job System.

## Requirements

For further development or improvements, individuals will need to have a copy of the Unity 5.0 Software in order to develop further. You will also need an understanding of the C# Programming Language.
